### Prerequisites

The installer will automatically check and install:
- **Go** (1.21 or later)
- Platform-specific package managers (Homebrew, apt, dnf, choco, etc.)

## üéØ Usage

### 1. Project Creation

#### Interactive Mode
Simply run `went` or `went new` without any arguments:

```bash
went
# or
went new
```

#### Command Line Mode
```bash
went new --name my-awesome-project --template API --deployment Docker --router gin
```

#### Router Selection
WentPlate supports multiple HTTP routers:

- **Gin** (default): Fast and simple web framework
- **Chi**: Lightweight, composable router

Choose your router during project creation or via `.env` configuration:

```bash
# Create project with Chi router
went new --name my-app --router chi

# Or set in .env file
echo "ROUTER=chi" > .env
went make:controller User  # Uses Chi template
```

### 2. Code Generation (Laravel Artisan Style)

#### Generate Models
```bash
went make:model User
went make:model Product
```

#### Generate Controllers

went make:controller Auth
went make:controller User
```

#### Generate Middleware
```bash
went make:middleware JWT
went make:middleware CORS
```

#### Generate Services

went make:service User
went make:service Email
```

#### Generate Migrations
```bash
went make:migration create_users_table
went make:migration add_email_to_users
```

### 3. Package Management

```bash
# Install Gin web framework
went pkg:install https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin gin

# Install GORM

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/     # Generated controllers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Generated models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/     # Generated middleware
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Generated services
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/     # Generated migrations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/               # Installed packages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/     # Template files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wentconfig.json   # Project configuration
```

## üì¶ Package Management

WentPlate includes a powerful package management system that allows you to:

1. **Install packages** directly from Git repositories into a local `pkg/` folder
2. **Manage dependencies** without affecting your `go.mod`
3. **Update import paths** to use local packages
4. **Version control** your dependencies as part of your project

This is particularly useful for:
- **Private packages** that aren't available in public repositories
- **Vendoring dependencies** for air-gapped environments
- **Customizing third-party packages** without forking
- **Ensuring reproducible builds** across environments
